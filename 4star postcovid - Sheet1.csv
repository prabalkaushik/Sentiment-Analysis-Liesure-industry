The employees searched the area thoroughly and retrieved my wedding ring.    There has been negative experiences in hotels of lesser stature.

Room ok ok.. They had buffet breakfast and mix of items which was good. No bath tub in the room.   They have one strange policy of not bringing the food from outside. It may be good for business travelers but not nice for families for sure. This is one biggest negative point. Visitors are also not allowed...   I'll not recommend probably.,1/1/2020,3

Pathetic staff . Our group has checked in for a business meeting. Super lazy staff at the check-in counter. 2 guys, one constantly on phone refusing to checkin the guests standing in a queue , dirty pillow covers , unchanged linen in the rooms , basic amenities like hair dryer are missing , no buffet in restaurant, arrogant house keeping staff refusing outrightly to address any requests and also refusing to disclose their names. The chef with hardly any knowledge about all this is the acting Manager on Duty. Despite clear instructions and confirmation from hotel for btc still demanding payments for food etc. Pathetic. We checked in and had to wait for 2 hours for linens to be changed . The only saving grace was that the food was decent though service was horribly slow.   Not at all recommended to anyone. The rooms are very tiny sized however what is not acceptable is the unhygienic linen and pathetic behaviour of staff.

This place must be from the old era that has not been refurbished or repaired for a very long time. The water from the tap is yellowish... bathroom doors get ""accidentally"" locked, and surprise guests drop in during the night... cockroaches, rats mosquitoes... the kids loved it all: the Delhi June heat, intermittently working AC, unclean toilets... rats... cockroaches... smelly beds and linens... I guess that's promoting sustainability... community-use towels... a truly medieval living... It was all topped with ungroomed rude staff, these definitely are not hotel management graduates... guess how great our holiday was... welcome to The Ruffin Plaza Hotel...",1/6/2022,1

Courtesy taxi from the airport brought me very tired and emotional to this hotel. The concierge received me from the taxi driver without a welcome glance. I was handed over to check in staff and processed, I had 10 minutes of food left and hadn't eaten in hours so I head straight there. The restaurant staff are the reason I am writing this review - they were excellent! They did not have me on the list as obviously I hadn't actually been booked to be there but it wasn't a problem and I was ushered to a table while they sorted that out. Unfortunately, I was incredibly emotional at having a long delay, missed my connecting flight home to my family and my luggage was missing so even though I needed to eat, my body wasn't cooperating and as it was the last few minutes of service what was left of the buffet did not look appetising at all.  I have a few bites and gave in, opting to head to my room and end this horrendous day. I was stopped on the way out by the restaurant manager - unfortunately did not get his name. He noticed my little sustenance and probably my emotional state and he insisted on sending up a cup of tea to my room with biscuits. i have never drunk a better tasting cup of tea than that one and the gesture was gratefully received more than he can ever know. I asked at reception on check out the next morning for his name so I could leave a compliment but they didn't give it to me. So if it was you and you're reading this, thank you so much for your kindness and caring. I really needed that!…",1/6/2022,3

WHY PEOPLE CHOSE TO STAY IN GOOD HOTEL ESPECIALLY HOTELS WITH ABOVE FOUR STAR RATING?  People can give their answers whenever they want to. My answer to this question is-  Hygiene-  these days self care and protection of body is very very important because pandemic situation is not fully sought yet. And from my point of view if hygiene and cleanliness is there in the hotels then there should not be any other problem. And of course sanitisation which is already compulsory but hotels are not following the pandemic protocols. No masks and no sanitisation.  I would like to appreciate Mr. Dev Dhaiya head of FNB dept.

My b'day on 20th Oct was another reason for us to select these dates. On the day of Check-In itself we had brief incident, which led us to believe that Hotel's house keeping staff is motivated to look after their customers.

Regular Rooms are average, Bathrooms are small with very limited amenities. At the price point offered and the aero city location, they aren’t bad. The suites are value for money and are better equipped. If you can spend a little extra, taking a suite is a better bet.   F&B options are limited, the bar/lounge offers limited cocktail hour choices which is disappointing. Breakfast is good, F&B crew takes good care and is responsive.

The only Negative is that the infra in some rooms is getting a bit old, plugs dont work and in this visit, the toilet water, which they apparently reuse, had a foul smell and other guests complained too.

I am very grateful for the staff there.  Only thing I didnt like is desk managers are made to stand for 12 hours with no chairs, sitting is not allowed for them.
