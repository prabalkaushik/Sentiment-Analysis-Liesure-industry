I was told that all the key cards are sent for sanitisation and I will not be allowed to enter my own room. Yes! That happened to me. I realised that I left my key card in my room and they denied me another key. When I ask them to escort me to my room to prove that I left it they give me another key.

We were told that there were some renovations taking place in the hotel but we did not hear any sounds, so I am guessing they managed the renovations with minimal impact to their guests.  There is a nice walking path along the water 2 minutes from the hotel.

The best part of the hotel stay was Sustainability measures they took - no plastic bottles in the room - it was all glass bottles and more bottles available on request. Assuming 150 rooms, they definitely reduced plastic waste of about 500 bottles per day. At restaurant Vista too similar arrangement for water so I think overall the Hotel may be saving plastic waste worth a Ton per month or more.  Room was clean, carpeted, well lit and bath area was also good.

Second thing which concerns the most is zero Covid appropriate behaviour observed by these crowds ultimately putting everyone else at risk and unfortunately hotel management washes off its ownership & responsibility from ensuring a safe environment for all guests in general - ultimately same pool of hotel resources serve, clean, cook etc for this party crowd which puts everyone at risk.

The room had a big glass facade that gives uninterrupted sea views. The rooms are well maintained, clean and comfortable.

It was truly incredible how I felt from the moment I entered the building. Also the people who work there are so professional and helpful. They are like always there when you need something. Especially Rochelle from guest relations. She helped us through our stay and arranged everything as expected. It is really anâ\\x80¦\",\n",

Vista had decent food. Only 1 choice of chicken, for dinner. Breakfast options were good. It was my husband's birthday, I requested for a slice of a small cake a day prior ,had it been any other 5 star ,I wouldn't even have to mention that,since they have the ID details.. but nobody reverted back, so later I ordered one at the end of the day. Having the TATA name connected, it was a very average experience, won't be visiting again for sure.\",\n",

I have meeting till 1 o clock and requested if they can allow me to keep one of the rooms I booked till that time and they have shown me the displeasure in best possible way...

Some of the staff members just don't seem to have the Classic Taj values. We felt that some of them were very good, while some of them just didn't care enough to make you feel welcome. But thats okay, as long as they are managing to keep people safe during this time. Maybe it's just this time  The rooms have gotten old now and seem a bit dated.

The attendant made the changes accordingly when we complained, but you don't expect this at TAJ.  3. The receptionists were especially rude.

However the food (especially the Set buffet) was not good, not much variety and service was poor. Due to Covid times, most hotels let patrons wear gloves and take the food themselves but here inadequate staff serves you - which is not very efficient.

The start was great as we were upgraded to club room which had free cocktail and snacks hours. The physical key has been replaced by soft key and the terms and conditions etc were patiently explained to us. Our room was on the top most floor of the hotel so the view was nice.

We were staying with our 2 year old, and the staff went out of their way to ensure we have a worry-free stay. From Keshav who was god send and made sure that we always had baby preferred food at all times, to the Chef who listened and made my child's food the exact way I would make it at home to Vishwa at the Club Lounge who knew exactly what we needed after a long day of meetings and toddler tantrums and always had our favorite food waiting.

Inspite of Covid restrictions, the hospitality was exceptional. The team sent board games for the kids to enjoy in the room and some fancy spa toiletries for my wife.

The bling gold and rust lobby will feel like some movie set from 80s Food is mediocre and service is zero. Dirty cutlery and food area. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll find staff hovering around in coffee shop and Indian restaurant for tip like it is there right.  Smelly washrooms and clear lack of sanitisation,   Not to miss the whole drama of protesting people outside was a weird sight though nothing unusual as last time my friend visitedâ\\x80¦',\n",

They are real gems who are making the hotel shine even more with there efficient customer dealing skills.  On the improvement side, just a suggestion - Breakfast setup and service needs attention. Try to make the morning merrier for all internal and external guests. Other details were shared with the Vista team. Thanks once again and see you soon.',\n",

Did not get a chance to eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel unfortunately, but breakfast on the second floor was great each morning.  They have a really big business centre on the ground floor, good place to work, and to have small conferences.  Only problem I had was the room wifi was a bit slow at times, other than that this was a wonderful stay experience.',\n",
       " 'The location is wonderful, rooms with sea view on higher floors make this a memorable stay. This was our first stay, The concierge and reception staff was helpful and courteous. Inroom dining experience was good. But the coffee shop experience at the Vista in the evening and at breakfast next day was disappointing. Average food quality and staff finding it difficult to smile and display warmth made the experience a forgettable one.',\n",

       " 'The check in and help from hotel manager was superb. While the club room views were fantastic, the club lounge experience spoiled it a lot. When restaurants are open most of the time, there is now no reason to limit lounge timings, it led to lot of rush in cocktail hours. The quality of brands at lounge is sub standard to say the least. I expect better from Taj and better from club status rooms. The lunch spread was good but falls short in comparison to other competitors. Lunch was strangely very spicy, not kid friendly. They were kind to offer a main course for the child. Breakfast was decent, but again on peak days it gets really crowded.',\n",

A special mention to Mr Francis Carlos, Assistant Director F&B who went above and beyond to ensure I had a comfortable stay. He exemplifies the true essence of Taj. In addition, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to acknowledge the brilliant customer service rendered by Rupesh and Mervin from F&B team who were equally kind.

While making the reservations I was told itâ\\x80\\x99s a mix of Indian and continental but actually it turned out to be an Indian buffet with mainly vegetarian dishes. The food is not very tasty, some of the dishes were very cold. Compare to other Taj hotels in Mumbai this buffet is at the lowest level.  Being a share holder of IHCL feel very sad that the Taj standards have been lowered to such a level.I hope the Management takes a serious review.',\n",

But the room was not well equipped with double pax supplies. Had to ask for slippers, and then bathrobe which took an hour to deliver. All minibar glasses were dirty, room was dusty, and request took too long to deliver which is not expected from the brand hotel. There was no cake and any flowers which i had requested even during my reservation. One suggestion is to provide sanitisers and mask to the guest which other set of hotels are providing.   I feel services need to be improved. There was no call back in room to inform guest about closure of request, no one calls back for the queries too.. Overall it was a disappointed stay ',\n",

Will definitely book again in the near future. Keep up the good work',\n",

I had booked with a package which included discounts on food and beverages ,however no discount was applied when I checked bills during final settlement.

I understand that there are limitations in current scenario but they just kept saying we will call back and update on the same. We kept waiting for an update entire evening and then finally gave up and went for dinner at 10pm. Atleast they should called back as a courtesy. ',\n",

Breakfast is good and varied, as in the reviews. Other services are average. The security features for clients are cumbersome and unfortunately easily bypassed. Mind; late night transport to and from there is expensive and travel time quite long. WIfi is extremely limited to a few appliances only and is slow and not all over the place. TV programmes are very limited. Other lesser hotels do better. Anyway, once tasted, twice shy. Look for other bargains.

Old furniture, old phones, not up to date information regarding hotel services, plumbing issues, etc. They try to compensate with the great attitude and service (for example room cleaning was the best I saw in the long time), but this does not work all the time due to seems to be some systemic issues.

We observed some of the other guests receiving the famed Taj hospitality (welcome drink etc.) but unfortunately we were not offered anything of this sort!  During check-in we were informed that only 1 of our 2 rooms was ready (we had arrived at 3pm which is 1 hour after stipulated check-in time). We were told that we could check in to 1 room and the other would be ready after 15-20 minutes. This did not happen until around 4pm I got a call from guest services asking if I had received the keyâ\\x80¦',\n",

       " \"We had a party of 11 celebrating my fathers birthday at the Vista restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. I flew in from Australia specially for this event. The buffet was great and the ambience was amazing, but the service was so slow and almost didn't bother. I ordered for a coke and it took them 45 minutes to bring it out (I had to ask 3 times to 3 different waiters and finally asked a manager). Most of our drinks came out after the meal. My dad asked for cold meat cuts- which they said they're happy to provide, but that too came way after we were done with desserts.   It was almost as if the wait staff didn't care. As someone who's been in hotels all over the world- it didn't live up to its name and reputation. However, the food was delicious and very good.\",\n",
       " 'We stayed here at the start of our break as it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t too far away from the airport.  The foyer, rooms and pool areas are lovely and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  We ate at their Indian restaurant and the food was excellent.  We also had the buffet one evening which had a good selection of food.  As this was our first time to Mumbai we were a little unsure of location. It took an hour to get to the gateway of India.  Very heavy traffic as you would expect.  No fault of the hotel at all but be prepared to travel a bit. All in all a lovely visit.',\n",

When paying the final bill I clearly told the cashier to collect the balance due in Rupees but the cashier collected this in pounds using exchange rate set by the hotel which was 10% more expensive than mid market rate set by credit card provider. I have written to the hotel but have no response from them.',\n",

The buffet breakfast was delicious and offered great views of the sea. The location in Bandra was convenient to shopping, tourism and visiting family all over Mumbai.  My only (small) complaint is the pool itself isn't very big. However the facility has a nice hot tub to ease your pains away. \",\n",

From the very minute I entered the building through check out the experience was a 180 degrees different from the last trip here.  Can't beat the location and the overall Taj hospitality. From Ganesh and Bharat in the club lounge to Rajendra in housekeeping, they made the entire trip so pleasant, I almost did not feel like leaving! Breakfast in the club lounge was amazing. I did not use it in the evenings, so I cannot comment on the quality of the drinks etc. But breakfast was superb!\",\n",

Pity for us was that December is wedding season and you get lots of families visiting from the villages, staying with many people in one room making lots of noise and not being bothered with other guests. The only bad experience we had was in the Vista restaurant for the a la carte dinner which took a long time and the quality was dissappointing. Maybe we should have gone for buffet that day,but we were not really hungry after a big Christmas lunch outside with friends. Having said that, the quality and variety of daily breakfast being served in the same Vista restaurant was extremely good!',\n",

Among Starters,I liked only Chickhen Malai Kebab and Paneer Tikka. It was well cooked and the taste was also good while the other starters was not all good because very less of masala powder and salt was used. The Green chutney was tastless. Among the main course, I liked only the Thai Curry while the Laal maas, rotis and Veg Biryani was not at all good. This Taj Lands end doesn`t have the taste like before. The Desserts were excellent. I had Rabdi and Rasgoullas. It was tasting awesome and the sweetness used in the desserts was good. I didn`t quite enjoy the food made in this Taj Hotel.',\n",

Later some pasta/mexican. But what about those who didnt want to have any of those? We just had to keep waiting and people got hungry and restless. Some had to travel back home to another city or country, but could not get done with the dinner.

The breakfast at the Taj Landsend is incredible and totally worth opting for. I didn't have much else to eat there, except a small snack one night, which too was fine though not spectacular.

I have actually been staying at the Taj Lands End hotel for the past 10 years and absolutely love it. This hotel is highly recommended. A special mention must go out to Merlin, Ganesh Erande, Bharat Pal, Mohit Bhujang, Preetam Koli at the Taj Club Lounge. They are so amazing and so professional. The Taj Group of hotels are the best in the world. The staff really know how to make people feel special and welcome.',\n",

Mumbai is fortunate to have a medley of a dozen such gladiators from the older lot down South to the newer ones in Bandra and Andheri. Given the shift of the majority of the city's business to Bandra Kurla Complex and Lower Parel there is now, more than ever, compelling reason to stay at the Taj Land's End located in proximity to both.   I found the rooms spacious and comfortable, with none of the plastic-disposable feel that plagues the Trident and Oberoi. The views are stunning and the staff quietly helpful and not overbearing. The lobby space is modest but gets the job done. The only real disappointment is in the F&B section - the breakfast is nowhere near the south mumbai hotels and the sandwich quality -â\\x80¦\",\n",
