# Sentiment Analysis for Leisure Industry

This repository contains hotel review datasets from TripAdvisor alongside notebooks for scraping and analyzing the text data.

- **Pre-COVID reviews**: `2star precovid*`, `3star precovid*`, `4star precovid*`, `5star precovid*`
- **Post-COVID reviews**: `2star postcovid*`, `3star postcovid*`, `4star postcovid*`, `5star postcovid*`

Only the `.csv` versions of the scraped TripAdvisor reviews are kept in the repository.
