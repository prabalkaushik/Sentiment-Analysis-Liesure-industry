Any 3 star hotel would have provided me a better experience.  1. We were made to wait 45 minutes for towels and toiletries. We had to call about 5 times still we were made to wait. The staff came only with the toiletries so had to send him back to get towels. (This was at 11 am in the morning) 2. The bathroom door used to get stuck. 3. There were stains on the bath tub. 4. The wire of the telephone was loose and came off on use. 5. A 5 star hotel can afford some HD channels on TV.  Overall, the experience was very meagre. I would not recommend staying here if you are looking for a 5 star experience.",1/9/2021,1

They have reasonable parking space, so if there are too many guests with separate cars then finding a place will be a challenge. But I believe that's a problem with Mumbai as there isn't much space.  The rooms were of decent size and so were the beds. The beds were big enough to accommodate parents and 1 kid. The sheets and linen were clean and so were the other pieces of furniture. Fridge though need to be maintained as I bruised my hand with a loose barcode scanner, which is there to scan and bill contents, if we take them out. There weren't any items though!  Bathrooms were good but there were some leaks, which need to be fixed. Shaving mirror was not available in all rooms.  There was a peculiar smell in the lobby, which remained for the period of entire stay. I saw other guests asking for room fresheners.  The food was really good. They put lot of thought behind everything they prepare and the way they serve it. There were Hot n cold glasses, bowls and plates and Cold coffee bottles were placed in ice water.  I was able to taste Coconut in the chutney, which is rare these days because of preservatives. Sambhar was too good with loads of traditional vegetables, whereas in other places we usually get water with some added masala and very few veggies. Breakfast was a blend of 3 type of food Scrambled egg - english style; Paranthas - punjabi and Idli, utappam - south indian to highlight and many other items as well.  Overall the stay was pleasent and the staff was friendly too!  …",1/2/2020,4

During this time you will also have to probably ask a few more people for the same order.  The hotel phones in the room do not have a number to contact reception and when you call concierge they can transfer you to the reception however the reception never answers the phone.

I checked in late on the 10th and requested Rohit to give me a quite room preferably on higher floor. He lied that only 1 room (207) was available and to take it or leave it.

But room service is responsive and try to fix the problem sincerely. This hotel offers bed and breakfast which is buffet. I found breakfast is very average. Hotel staffs are well behaved and Security is sufficient.   Problem of the location of the Hotel is its very far from the main city, old delhi, market places important specially for those who are interested in shopping. Convenience can be a headache if need to visit these place repeatedly. A Auto stand is at walking distance. I could save some money after hiring autos from there.

On the other hand i called Ibis with the same enquiry and they were more than happy to go an extra mile to help me.
