Close to the Gateway of India (3.5 Km or 10 mins by Taxi) and around 40 mins from the Siddhivinayaka temple. 30 mins to Mahalaxmi temple. 20 Mins walk to the Marine drive.

First off, this is a hotel masquerading as a heritage style hotel, but in reality it’s just one shady hallway in a building that is in shambles. Even if it seems like a value for money place in a nice location, the rooms in fact have no windows and just the experience of entering the building will turn you off.  Now here’s what happened: We were a group visiting for a wedding. We had booked 3 rooms and were 3 married couples and one single. While booking we informed Mr. Sunil about the people coming, and he said it shouldn’t be a problem as long we had our IDs. Once there they asked us not only for our IDs but also for proof of marriage. They told us that Unmarried couples are not allowed and when we told him we would split the rooms with boys and girls in separate rooms, he said that we would not be allowed to go into each other’s rooms. When we showed them a marriage certificate- they asked for Family photos from the wedding! Since we were really looking to freshen up and head to the wedding events, we showed some photos. Then he asked us to email those private photos as evidence. This is the most ludicrous and backward thing I have ever heard. Why should I share family photos of my wedding with a shady hotel for their record, after we provided them evidence. When we objected about this, they told us that if there was a raid they’d need proof. NO DECENT HOTEL EXPECTS RAIDS. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A DECENT HOTEL. NO HOTEL ASKS FOR PRIVATE PHOTOS. The desk staff escalated the matter to a Mr. Hemant over the phone who was incredibly rude. How this man is pursuing a career in hospitality is truly shocking! He spoke to us like he was a bouncer denying us entry in some exclusive club. He told us WE HAD TO send him wedding photos and that if we didn’t we would not be given a room. He said you are free to leave. Absolutely bizarre and harrowing experience. This decrepit place does not deserve self-respecting clientele. PLEASE FIND ANOTHER OPTION. You will find several more- it’s mumbai and there are options by the dozen. We got another hotel at the same rate with much better rooms and service who did not ask for anything other than our ID proof.  PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AN DO NOT BOOK HERE.…",1/3/2022,1

We chose this after our original choice turned out to be effectively a 1 star hotel, which we abandoned for Le Grande. Everywhere is beautifully and tastefully tiled. We were on the 6th floor, Executive room. I would stay here again without question. (Maybe the rooms on the other floors are different).  The room was very large with large desk/mirror (brilliant!), bed was comfortable, but duvet had the odd stains. There was a safe but didn't use. Tea/coffee/kettle/bottles of water. The bathroom was ok; not as plush and the walk in shower didn't have a curtain (broken rail) or a glass shield (as in the official pictures) - please install to prevent the whole floor from being wet.  Also I would recommend that wall liquid soap dispensers are installed to save on soap wastage and on small plastic bottles.  Breakfast was a disappointment: 2 or 3 hot spicy Indian dishes (varied daily), omelette with chillies, bread, butter, jam (only on one day), papaya chunks, watermelon juice, tea/coffee to order. No cereals/pastries/cakes. I don't like to have lunch/dinner as breakfast so I avoided all spicy dishes and asked for plain omelettes each day, and had bread and juice. Not having cereals was a MAJOR disappointment - but strangely it WAS available for extra on room service!  Had dinner a couple of times and they were great. Dinning room is great, the foyer is large and 2 people at reception.  We also needed to have PCR test done. The hotel arranged for someone to come to the room (Rs 800). Got the result in about 24hrs. There was an anomaly on one of the results which the hotel contacted the lab to have it corrected. Funnily the hotel got the PDF results and not on our phone. Providers were TruTest Laboratories in association with  IGenetic Diagnostics.  Hotel is on a quiet road, so no noise from nearby main road. A park with exercising machines is directly opposite.

This time was our third stay. The staff are wonderful. Every year we get to try a different wing and the reception go out of their way to give us noise free as the metro construction is all around. There is abundant coffee and tea. Breakfast is very good. Everyone remembers us. We are recommended a wonderful nearby restaurant. Every member of staff is helpful. And totally honest which I can vouch for as my husband's wallet fell out of his pocket and even before he noticed it one of the staff came running with it. Our Mumbai home ,1/2/2020,5

Located just off one of New Delhi's main strips for good bars & restaurants, the location is ideal either as a base from which to see the city or as an overnight stay within a 5 minute walk of the main train station.  By far and away the best feature is the staff. The hospitality we received was excellent, with 24/7 care, and our hosts were amendable to a host of requests, from last minute extensions on our stay to sorting our laundry & shopping requirements (for hardly any profit). They have a license to navigate the complicated train system (almost impossible for foreign nationals to navigate) and essentially helped us to book trains, planes & cars for half of our month long trip around the country.

The overall room sizes are good. All rooms are clean, well equipped with latest amenities and clean bathrooms as well. The corridors are bright and vibrant too which makes everything pleasant and makes you feel secured. Shops, market and station is very close by.   Cons: The staff should be more polite at times. They took a lot of time to complete our requests eg. Getting the complementary water bottles, setting up the extra bed.  There wasn't any room cleaning done on daily basis. They began cleaning as we were about to check out.   Breakfast menu was the same for both the days that we stayed.  All in all this is the best and safe hotel you will get in Pahadganj area, especially if you are traveling with family. Bear in mind that the cost is slightly on the higher side as compared to nearby hotels.  Tip: The complementary shuttle from airport is only offered for pick ups.

Each time we booked a superior room. The first stay, the room was very nice and quiet, with a good, hot shower. The second time the room was far inferior, with only a window to the corridor, which only created more noise. The third stay was a little better, but the bathroom had a vented opening that could not be closed, even when it was cold and rainy. Not sure why we could never get the same room we had the first time, even though we requested it in advance. None of the rooms were as nice as though posted by the hotel. I had to double check that it was the same hotel because of how different the rooms looked. Food from the restaurant on site was pretty good and fresh omelettes were available…",1/12/2021,3

It is scrupulously clean, with cool and spacious communal indoor lounges as well as a lovely roof terrace. Delicious and interesting food with great explanations of what’s on the plate.

But - due to the COVID pandemic and the unfolding International situation our stay became considerably longer.  We were privileged to meet Col. Khanna on our first morning in India, a treat not always available as he no longer manages the Retreat himself, but one we all cherished as he talked about his love of cricket,his travels and his special incites into Delhi, a city he is passionately fond of.  A chat casually held over a wonderful, traditional, India Breakfast on the rooftop balcony. The retreat is situated in a lovely, upmarket, area of Delhi, conveniently close to Markets, restaurants and the metro. The rooms are spacious, cool and extremely clean. Communal dining and lounges on each floor encourage socialisation with other travelers, but if you prefer they also offer quiet spaces to read, write and contemplate the incredible experiences you will have had out sightseeing. High Tea is offered free of charge every afternoon, if the weather allows on the rooftop, otherwise in the upper lounge - Suman's chocolate cakes, like her banana bread, are truly scrumptious. The evening meal,ordered a minimum of an hour before you wish to dine, offers a good selection of tasty, fresh, home made curries and accompaniments - the price is reasonable and the service fantastic. If you are lucky enough to dine on the rooftop, keep on eye out for the nightly migration of fruit bats! Suman and Arun make a personal effort to chat with their guests, offering sightseeing ideas, and tips for getting the most out of a city and country they are very passionate about. Our, unexpected, extended stay at Colonels Retreat was a bonus of the evolving crisis we found ourselves in, and we can not thank enough all the staff at the Retreat for the support, advise and shelter they gave us at a truly challenging time. We will be back and we will stay at Colonels Retreat! Namaste…",1/3/2020,5

Our room was large, clean, with king size bed and en suite shower bathroom. The roof terrace was a delight to have your meals or drinks on.  All meals were exceptionally tasty with large portions and of a high standard. The Tandoori Chicken is a must.  All served with a good selection of wine and beer.  A free afternoon tea with banana cake was provided and a very welcome treat after a days sightseeing. The breakfast we found of a high standard also and included cereals, fruit, yoghurt, eggs cooked fresh to your liking, with toast and jams.   The location was perfect to see the sights of old and New Delhi.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  All in all we would highly recommend this place…",1/3/2020,5

Khanna on our first morning in India, a treat not always available as he no longer manages the Retreat himself, but one we all cherished as he talked about his love of cricket,his travels and his special incites into Delhi, a city he is passionately fond of.  A chat casually held over a wonderful, traditional, India Breakfast on the rooftop balcony. The retreat is situated in a lovely, upmarket, area of Delhi, conveniently close to Markets, restaurants and the metro. The rooms are spacious, cool and extremely clean. Communal dining and lounges on each floor encourage socialisation with other travelers, but if you prefer they also offer quiet spaces to read, write and contemplate the incredible experiences you will have had out sightseeing. High Tea is offered free of charge every afternoon, if the weather allows on the rooftop, otherwise in the upper lounge - Suman's chocolate cakes, like her banana bread, are truly scrumptious. The evening meal,ordered a minimum of an hour before you wish to dine, offers a good selection of tasty, fresh, home made curries and accompaniments - the price is reasonable and the service fantastic. If you are lucky enough to dine on the rooftop, keep on eye out for the nightly migration of fruit bats! Suman and Arun make a personal effort to chat with their guests, offering sightseeing ideas, and tips for getting the most out of a city and country they are very passionate about.
