Close to the Gateway of India (3.5 Km or 10 mins by Taxi) and around 40 mins from the Siddhivinayaka temple. 30 mins to Mahalaxmi temple. 20 Mins walk to the Marine drive.

First off, this is a hotel masquerading as a heritage style hotel, but in reality it’s just one shady hallway in a building that is in shambles. Even if it seems like a value for money place in a nice location, the rooms in fact have no windows and just the experience of entering the building will turn you off.  Now here’s what happened: We were a group visiting for a wedding. We had booked 3 rooms and were 3 married couples and one single. While booking we informed Mr. Sunil about the people coming, and he said it shouldn’t be a problem as long we had our IDs. Once there they asked us not only for our IDs but also for proof of marriage. They told us that Unmarried couples are not allowed and when we told him we would split the rooms with boys and girls in separate rooms, he said that we would not be allowed to go into each other’s rooms. When we showed them a marriage certificate- they asked for Family photos from the wedding! Since we were really looking to freshen up and head to the wedding events, we showed some photos. Then he asked us to email those private photos as evidence. This is the most ludicrous and backward thing I have ever heard. Why should I share family photos of my wedding with a shady hotel for their record, after we provided them evidence. When we objected about this, they told us that if there was a raid they’d need proof. NO DECENT HOTEL EXPECTS RAIDS. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A DECENT HOTEL. NO HOTEL ASKS FOR PRIVATE PHOTOS. The desk staff escalated the matter to a Mr. Hemant over the phone who was incredibly rude. How this man is pursuing a career in hospitality is truly shocking! He spoke to us like he was a bouncer denying us entry in some exclusive club. He told us WE HAD TO send him wedding photos and that if we didn’t we would not be given a room. He said you are free to leave. Absolutely bizarre and harrowing experience. This decrepit place does not deserve self-respecting clientele. PLEASE FIND ANOTHER OPTION. You will find several more- it’s mumbai and there are options by the dozen. We got another hotel at the same rate with much better rooms and service who did not ask for anything other than our ID proof.  PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AN DO NOT BOOK HERE.…",1/3/2022,1

We chose this after our original choice turned out to be effectively a 1 star hotel, which we abandoned for Le Grande. Everywhere is beautifully and tastefully tiled. We were on the 6th floor, Executive room. I would stay here again without question. (Maybe the rooms on the other floors are different).  The room was very large with large desk/mirror (brilliant!), bed was comfortable, but duvet had the odd stains. There was a safe but didn't use. Tea/coffee/kettle/bottles of water. The bathroom was ok; not as plush and the walk in shower didn't have a curtain (broken rail) or a glass shield (as in the official pictures) - please install to prevent the whole floor from being wet.  Also I would recommend that wall liquid soap dispensers are installed to save on soap wastage and on small plastic bottles.  Breakfast was a disappointment: 2 or 3 hot spicy Indian dishes (varied daily), omelette with chillies, bread, butter, jam (only on one day), papaya chunks, watermelon juice, tea/coffee to order. No cereals/pastries/cakes. I don't like to have lunch/dinner as breakfast so I avoided all spicy dishes and asked for plain omelettes each day, and had bread and juice. Not having cereals was a MAJOR disappointment - but strangely it WAS available for extra on room service!  Had dinner a couple of times and they were great. Dinning room is great, the foyer is large and 2 people at reception.  We also needed to have PCR test done. The hotel arranged for someone to come to the room (Rs 800). Got the result in about 24hrs. There was an anomaly on one of the results which the hotel contacted the lab to have it corrected. Funnily the hotel got the PDF results and not on our phone. Providers were TruTest Laboratories in association with  IGenetic Diagnostics.  Hotel is on a quiet road, so no noise from nearby main road. A park with exercising machines is directly opposite.

This time was our third stay. The staff are wonderful. Every year we get to try a different wing and the reception go out of their way to give us noise free as the metro construction is all around. There is abundant coffee and tea. Breakfast is very good. Everyone remembers us. We are recommended a wonderful nearby restaurant. Every member of staff is helpful. And totally honest which I can vouch for as my husband's wallet fell out of his pocket and even before he noticed it one of the staff came running with it. Our Mumbai home ,1/2/2020,5

Staff were very friendly and helpful. Also: be prepared that no taxi drivers I met knew of the hotel, so you'll end up having to direct them…",1/10/2014,3

Secondly I booked a double room but the size of the room was very small. I wonder what would be the size of a single room if double room is so small. There was dampness in the wall in the room, which was a negative point.They have rooms having individual split air conditioners instead of centralized.

From teaching how to use the water filter in the kitchen to helping us order delivery at midnight, they were extremely accomodating.

Their airport pick-up this time was better and never utilize their airport drop because they ask me to come back to the hotel for it which is simply not possible with a tight schedule, if they can renovate their rooms and improve their breakfast a bit, they will just be perfect.

Clean and functional rooms - terrace is gorgeous. I’m already planning staying again before my return flight.  Thanks Salman and team.,1/10/2019,5

Upon request they did lower the temperature by 1-2 Degrees which is unsatisfactory. The staff can’t do much about it (they’re only doing what they’re told) as they’re not allowed to…",1/5/2019,4

Great staff particularly the lady receptionist who was helpful and fantastic.  Great family room which slept 5 people without feeling cramped at all.

There were many complaints from all guests the next morning partly because despite repeated calls to the reception they refused to ask the workmen to return to complete the work the next day. To be clear the renovation was inside the hotel so this could easily be done. Staff were not very helpful during this whole incident.

The staff replenish the coffee, tea, and sugars near the bed every day. There are gauzy curtains and pretty views of the street.   The rooftop is especially beautiful and verdant, with a great view. This is where guests eat breakfast. I am already missing the masala dosa, banana, eggs, and coffee. Mrs. Khanna is very nice and gives excellent travel advice for Delhi.

But beware - the hostel is on the 3rd (or 4th floor) and there is no lift. If you've got a tonne of baggage, they'll help you down but not up. Because there's no way of letting them know you've arrived until you climb all the way up :)  Also the location is not metro accessible. Can't win em all :(",1/6/2017,5

The staff are SUPER personable, easy to talk to and are helpful with travel plans. The space is awesome, a cool rooftop patio to do yoga on, chill out, drink beer, etc.  They have home made breakfast available every morning for 100 rupees, and dinner for ... 150? something like that.  The location isn't bad, not far from the metro or the airport.  I liked how it was difficult to find, provided more privacy. The place doesn't have a sign out front so it's not really targeted as a tourist place.  It was also the cleanest place I had come across in my 5 weeks in India, and the hot water always worked which was also the first time I had experienced that in 5 weeks.",1/3/2017,5

The facilities are modern, clean, spacious and overall great. Common kitchen was clean, free drinking water, and great free breakfast in the morning. Before all I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it is a great place for solo travelers, easy to meet other backpackers. Also the staff went above and beyond for their guests (I was not feeling well and they made sure I really had everything I needed). We spend great evenings chilling on the rooftop and having great conversations.  The area the hostel is in is really nice, with everything you need in walking distance (shops, ATMs, restaurants, etc).  Would definitely recommend this place!",1/2/2017,5
